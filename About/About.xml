    <description>Farming Hysteresis lets you automate enabling and disabling growing zones based on the amount of product already in storage.

        I got tired of keeping track of these numbers myself, so I made a little mod to do it for me. Hopefully it can be of use to you too.

        &lt;size=24&gt;Operation&lt;/size&gt;

        The mod adds an "Enable farming hysteresis" to all supported growing zones and hydroponics basins. Only plants that produce a harvestable product are supported. When you enable this setting, the "Allow sowing" button is removed, and sowing and harvesting are instead controlled by a set of hysteresis bounds. Hydroponics basins typically don't have these settings, but with this mod and hysteresis enabled, sowing and/or cutting also stops on those when appropriate.

        When the amount of stored product goes below the lower bound, sowing and/or cutting is enabled. This remains enabled until the amount of stored product goes above the upper bound, at which point sowing and/or cutting is disabled. This then remains disabled until the amount of stored product once again goes below the lower bound.
