Farming Hysteresis lets you automate enabling and disabling growing zones and hydroponics basins based on the amount of product already in storage.

## Operation

The mod adds an "Enable hysteresis" gizmo to all supported growing zones and hydroponics basins. Only plants that produce a harvestable product are supported. When you enable this setting, the "Enable sowing" button is removed, and sowing and/or harvesting is instead controlled by a set of hysteresis bounds. Hydroponics basins typically don't have this setting, but with this mod and hysteresis enabled, sowing and/or harvesting also stops on those when appropriate.

When the amount of stored product goes below the lower bound, sowing and/or harvesting is enabled and remains enabled until the amount of stored product goes above the upper bound, at which point it is disabled and remains disabled until the amount of stored product once again goes below the lower bound.

Here's a graph illustrating the hysteresis process:

In this example, we assume the lower bound is set to 500, and the upper bound is set to 1000. As we can see by the three regions:

-   0-500 is the region below the "lower bound" in which sowing gets enabled if it were disabled,
-   500-1000 is the region between the "lower bound" and the "upper bound" in which no change to whether sowing is enabled or disabled is made,
-   1000+ is the region above the "upper bound" in which sowing gets disabled if it were enabled.

What this gives us is a way to build up a buffer of product, then hold off on production while we're consuming some of it, and then turning production back on when we're running low, but before we're running out.
